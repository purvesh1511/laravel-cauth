## Introduction

Vhits provides a minimal and simple starting point for building a Laravel application with authentication. Styled with Tailwind, Vhits publishes authentication controllers and views to your application that can be easily customized based on your own application's needs.

Laravel Vhits is powered by Blade and Tailwind. If you're looking for a more robust Laravel starter kit that includes two factor authentication, Livewire / Inertia support, and more, check out [Laravel Jetstream](https://jetstream.laravel.com).
